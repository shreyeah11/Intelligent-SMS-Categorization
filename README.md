## 📩 Intelligent SMS Categorization using Machine Learning

An intelligent system that automatically categorizes SMS messages using **Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
The project goes beyond traditional spam filtering by organizing messages into multiple meaningful categories, helping users manage their inbox efficiently.

This project was developed as part of an **academic seminar** in the **Machine Learning / NLP domain**.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Naive Bayes** — Efficient and fast for text-based classification  
- **Logistic Regression** — Probabilistic classification using One-vs-Rest for multi-class SMS categorization  
- **Decision Tree** — Rule-based classification for interpretable results  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** — High-accuracy classification for high-dimensional text data  

Models are evaluated using standard metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
